            <h1>Smart Investing for Passive Income!</h1>
            <p>We help you identify profitable stocks for <strong>dividend-based passive income 💰</strong>.</p>        </div>
    </header>

    <section id="info" class="info">
        <p><strong>💰 Dividend-based passive income</strong> refers to earnings generated from stocks that pay <strong>dividends</strong> regularly.</p>
        <p>📊 Dividends are <strong>profits</strong> distributed by companies to their shareholders, usually on a <strong>quarterly or annual</strong> basis.</p>
        <p>💤 Investors earn this income <em>passively</em> without actively trading stocks.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>🌟 Why It’s a Great Passive Income Strategy?</h2>
        <p>✅ <strong>Regular Income</strong> – Get paid without selling your stocks. 💵</p>
        <p>✅ <strong>Compounding Growth</strong> – Reinvest dividends to buy more shares. 📈</p>
        <p>✅ <strong>Lower Risk</strong> – Compared to active trading, dividend stocks provide stability. ⚖️</p>
        <p>✅ <strong>Works in Any Market</strong> – Earn income even when stock prices fluctuate. 🔄</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>⚙️ How It Works:</h2>
        <p>📌 <strong>Buy Dividend-Paying Stocks</strong> – Invest in companies that have a history of paying stable dividends.</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Hold the Stocks</strong> – You earn dividends as long as you own the shares.</p>
        <p>📌 <strong>Receive Payouts</strong> – Dividends are credited to your account (cash or reinvested in more shares). 💵</p>

        <h3>📊 Example:</h3>
        <p>🛒 You buy <strong>100 shares</strong> of a company offering a <strong>5% annual dividend yield</strong> at ₹1,000 per share.</p>
        <p>💰 Your total investment = <strong>₹1,00,000.</strong></p>
        <p>📅 Dividend payout = <strong>5% of ₹1,00,000 = ₹5,000 per year</strong> (₹1,250 per quarter).</p>
